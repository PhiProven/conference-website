The best known program for calibrating the strength of theorems from ordinary
mathematics is reverse mathematics (RM). RM's scale for measuring strength is
furnished by certain standard systems couched in the language of second order
arithmetic. However, its language is not expressive enough to be able to talk
about higher order objects, such as function spaces, directly.

Richer formal systems in which higher order mathematical objects can be
directly accounted for have been suggested. The price for maintaining
conservativity over elementary theories, however, is that one has to use
different logics for different ontological realms, allowing classical logic to
reign at the level of numbers but higher type mathematical objects only
governed by intuitionistic logic. In the talk, I'd like to present some of
these semi-intuitionistic systems, give a feel for carrying out mathematics
within them, and relate them to systems considered in RM.
