In this presentation, we explore various versions of the Russell-Prawitz
translation, which maps intuitionistic propositional calculus to
second-order propositional logic. The target system, introduced
independently by Jean-Yves Girard and John Reynolds, is known as System
F or polymorphic lambda-calculus. We analyze some properties of System F
and the translation, with a focus on atomic polymorphism and atomization
conversions. Our investigation examines the impact of introducing new
atomization conversions to System F [[2]](#JoseESpiritoSanto) and the more
radical option of replacing System F with an atomic polymorphic target
system. Specifically, we cover:

-   The original atomic polymorphic variant based on instantiation
    overflow [[4]](#Ferreira06)[[5]](#FerreiraFerreira12).

-   Enhancements such as a variant that improves proof and reduction
    sequence sizes through an improved form of instantiation overflow
    [[6]](#PistoneTranchiniPetrolo).

-   A variant based on the admissibility of disjunction and absurdity
    elimination rules, resulting in more compact proves and reduced
    administrative reductions [[1]](#JoseESpiritoSanto2019).

-   An approach that produces an image of intuitionistic propositional
    calculus truly free from commuting conversions
    [[3]](#JoseESpiritoSanto2024).

This exploration includes significant joint work with José Espírito
Santo.
