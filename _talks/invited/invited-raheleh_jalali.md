We study the connection between the form of the primitive rules of a proof
system and the rules the system admits. We introduce a general and syntactically
defined family of sequent-style calculi over the modal language and its
fragments as an approximate formalization for "constructively acceptable"
systems. We call these calculi constructive and show that any strong enough
constructive sequent calculus, satisfying a mild technical condition, feasibly
admits all Visser's rules. This means that there exists a polynomial-time
algorithm that, given a proof of the premise of a Visser's rule, provides a
proof for its conclusion.

As a positive application, we establish the feasible admissibility of Visser's
rules in several sequent calculi for intuitionistic modal logics, including
$$\sf CK$$, $$\sf IK$$, and their extensions by the modal axioms $$\sf T$$,
$$\sf B$$, $$\sf 4$$, $$\sf 5$$, and the axioms for bounded width and depth, and
propositional lax logic.

On the negative side, we show that if a strong enough intuitionistic modal logic
(satisfying a mild technical condition) does not admit at least one of Visser's
rules, then it cannot have a constructive sequent calculus. Consequently, no
intermediate logic other than $$\sf IPC$$ has a constructive sequent calculus.
