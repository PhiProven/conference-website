The 7<sup>th</sup> edition of the Wormshop will take place at Ghent University, **September 2 - 5, 2024**.

The tradition of modal logics inspired on the notion of formal proof dates back to GÃ¶del, but their study has gained great momentum in the last decade due to novel applications in the foundations of mathematics.
Their study moreover requires the interaction of several disciplines in mathematical logic and beyond, including computational logic, proof theory, and point-set topology.

The aim of this workshop is to bring together experts in relevant fields in order to discuss recent advances and foster new collaborations. Topics include but are not restricted to:

- Provability logics and algebras
- Lightweight fragments of modal logics
- Proof theory and ordinal analysis
- Weak and strong systems of arithmetic
- Modalities in topology and set theory
- Justification logics and logics of proofs
- Computability and complexity
