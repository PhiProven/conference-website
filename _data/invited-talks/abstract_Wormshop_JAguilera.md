We discuss some new topological spaces which are sound and complete for the
provability logic $$\sf GL.3$$ under suitable set-theoretic assumptions. One is
the space of all ordinals with the normal-measure topology, assuming $$\sf V$$
is a "fine-structural" model of set theory. Another is the cardinal number
$$\aleph_{\varepsilon_0}$$ with the closed-cofinal topology, assuming the Axiom
of Determinacy. This is joint work with G. Stepanov.
